# API parity protocol evidence

The 0.11.0 feature branch restores server message/people search, exact result
opening, direct exact-ID quotes, person mentions, virtual one-to-one chats and
channel root/thread/history routes. Implementations use Node built-ins. No
upstream runtime or browser is used for data operations.

## Authentication and search

Search uses `https://substrate.office.com` access tokens, acquired on demand
with the existing Teams refresh token and the fixed Microsoft token endpoint.
Base Skype/CSA tokens remain intact. Rotations are returned to Switchboard for
encrypted persistence during authorization, before dispatch. Local diagnostics
persist rotations through the shared owner-only session cache. An old bundle
without renewal credentials reports `search_token_required`; the adapter does
not open a browser merely to obtain a search token.

People suggestions use POST `/search/api/v1/suggestions`, a People entity query,
Mailbox/Directory provenances, the `peoplepicker.newChat` scenario and a fresh
`Cvid`. Message search uses POST `/search/api/v2/query`, a Message entity request,
Teams content source, Optimized property set, bounded `from`/`size`, a fresh
`cvid` and the `powerbar` scenario. References are listed in [THIRD_PARTY](../THIRD_PARTY.md).
Initial simplified requests returned HTTP 400 on this account; corrected
requests passed live on 2026-10-08. Fixture acceptance alone did not establish
the private protocol.

Live message results supplied `ClientConversationId`, `ClientThreadId` and
numeric `InternetMessageId`. The adapter checks consistent conversation/root
fields and stores only exact locators in account-bound expiring handles. It also
accepts exact message deep links on the two fixed Teams HTTPS origins. It never
fetches a supplied result URL. Membership is revalidated before reading; result
snippets do not select a recipient or authorize a send. Unsupported/missing
locators report `canOpen=false`, and removed messages fail explicitly.

## Exact messages, quotes and mentions

The regional exact-message GET is
`/v1/users/ME/conversations/<encoded conversation>/messages/<encoded message ID>`.
A live exact-message read and opening a chat search hit passed with the browser
closed. Direct quotes use this lookup, share the escaped quote builder with
triage and recheck selected content/version before dispatch. The private API
provides no atomic guard against a change after that check.

Person mention runs resolve an exact directory email again. Server profile MRIs
and display names supply escaped `schema.skype.com/Mention` spans and serialized
`properties.mentions` entries with matching numeric item IDs and `mentionType=person`.
Caller names do not select identities. At most 20 distinct people are resolved
per message. Structured chat sends, triage replies and edits share this builder.
Existing quotes/attachments remain protected from editing.

Quotes and mentions have source, fixture and authorized live server-readback
evidence. Native UI rendering and recipient notifications remain unverified.

## Virtual one-to-one conversations

The primary client reference resolves a new organization one-to-one chat as
`19:<self oid>_<peer oid>@unq.gbl.spaces`, persisted by its first message. The
adapter reuses existing directory chats first. A virtual opaque ID carries the
exact email and thread ID; resolution re-fetches that profile and verifies both
account and peer before accepting the virtual ID after reload. Self-chat,
group creation and arbitrary foreign virtual IDs are refused.

First sends use the existing durable message ledger. Recipient-bound operation
fingerprints replay after restart; uncertainty never triggers an automatic
resend. Fixture checks establish these local guarantees. Actual new-chat
persistence has not been live-verified; no arbitrary recipient was contacted.

## Channel reads and history

Membership-bound exact root reads use the regional message GET. Replies are
read from `<channel>;messageid=<numeric root ID>`, the source-verified composite
conversation. Reply-as-root and explicit sibling-thread mismatches are refused.
Root listing traverses the base channel with backward links and filters replies.

History validates every backward link against the fixed regional origin and
exact conversation path. Cursors bind account, channel, root, limit and format;
replay repeats the same page. The verified root is included once, overlap IDs
are deduplicated and NDJSON is available. A first thread page can include its
root in addition to the bounded reply page. Retention/unavailable history remain
outside `completeHistory=false` coverage.

Live checks on 2026-10-08 passed channel root listing and continuation, exact
thread reads and a thread NDJSON export. A subsequent saved-session check opened
a channel search hit, followed a reply-history continuation with limit=2 and
verified identical replay of the second page. This is sampled continuation
evidence, not a full retention or scale guarantee; cross-thread/cross-account cursor protection, overlap, replay
and redirect rejection have fixture coverage. Channel sends/replies, channel
read markers and automatic read-after-reply remain disabled.

## Shared-session and central renewal checks

One initial local session capture was followed by a separate silent API check,
forced HTTP renewal, and multiple read-only feature diagnostics. They reused the
shared saved credentials without repeated sign-in windows. Central `auth:sync`
returned `server_renewed` and verified fresh expiry/readiness on the existing
imported-token connection without a browser or token upload. These results do
not establish indefinite token lifetime, cookie-only recovery after expiry,
central reconnect upload or durable ledger recovery.

## Mutation confirmation and reaction availability

Acceptance is fsynced before confirmation. A saved account/thread/operation
context and content digest allow unfinished verification to resume after restart
without storing another copy of message content. At most two exact-message GETs
share a five-second budget; there are no automatic write retries. Failed reads
or verification persistence never discard the accepted receipt. Legacy receipts
without confirmation context explicitly report unavailable.

Send observation requires exact message/client ID, author, message type, content
and mention metadata. Edits check author and matching content/type/mentions;
deletions require an explicit tombstone rather than HTTP 404. Reactions compare
the requesting account's desired selection against validated emotions metadata.
Responses retain accepted_by_api and add verification.status of observed,
not_observed or unavailable. Saved observed results replay their historical
observation; they are not a current-state promise or recipient delivery receipt.
Private endpoints provide no atomic protection against later external changes.

Reaction availability combines presets and IDs observed on the exact message,
labels their source and explicitly reports an incomplete catalog. canSet means
adapter input compatibility only. Custom-ID metadata, malformed responses,
lagging reads, authorization failures, accepted-receipt replay and persistence
faults have fixture coverage. Authorized chat write readback subsequently passed as described below. Native
custom-reaction writes remain unverified. The full suite passed 158 tests.

## Follow-up read-only validation

On 2026-10-08, separate silent commands reused the saved diagnostic session
without another sign-in. Profile, conversation listing and recent-message reads
passed. Triage returned ten groups and three successful reply contexts. Its
eight coverage issues were unknown consumption horizons, not transport errors;
those sources cannot establish an unread boundary. The snapshot did not report
partial discovery, but the bounded inbox still had a continuation.

Exact-message reaction listing succeeded for nine sampled messages, including
four with existing reactions. One unavailable message was explicitly skipped.
Availability source labels and incomplete-catalog flags matched the contract.
Exact-email mention preparation resolved the signed-in account to its own MRI.
This checks identity preparation and existing metadata, not native rendering,
notification or post-write confirmation. No messages or read markers were
written during these read-only checks. Later authorized mutation evidence is
recorded below; new-chat persistence still requires a designated new recipient.

## Authorized chat-write validation

On 2026-10-08 the user designated the existing Brandon Haschick chat for test
sends, quotes/mentions, edits, deletion and reaction changes. Exact thread
membership and Brandon's directory MRI were matched before dispatch. Saved
credentials were reused silently for every command; no new sign-in was needed.
New-chat creation was not tested or authorized by this existing-chat designation.

Plain and formatted mention sends were accepted and observed by exact-message
readback. A combined quote/mention initially reported not_observed despite
matching client ID, author, type and mention metadata: Teams inserted CRLF
separators at the four native quote block boundaries. Supplying separators also
caused additional insertion. Confirmation now ignores only CRLFs at those four
positions in the exact generated native quote prefix. It retains all attributes,
quote IDs, author/preview text, reply content and mention metadata. Regression
checks reject changed quote IDs and changed reply text.

The final lifecycle passed all seven server observations: plain send, formatted
quoted mention, reaction add, reaction remove, edit, quote deletion and plain
message deletion. Both sends were replayed using fresh ledger instances with
the same keys; no additional write occurred. Every temporary message from the
initial checks and diagnostic iterations was deleted with observed tombstones.
The full suite passed 158 tests after the fix.

These checks validate adapter-to-server writes and matching readback on this
account. They do not establish recipient delivery/notifications, native UI
rendering, custom reaction support, channel writes or new-chat persistence.

## Regional conversation discovery

The primary pinned chat-service reference lists account conversations at
`/v1/users/ME/conversations?view=mychats&pageSize=<limit>` and follows the server's
backwardLink. Live links replace ME with the signed-in account MRI. The adapter
accepts only the fixed regional origin and these two exact account paths, with
no credentials/fragments. Foreign account/resource links, malformed schemas,
cycles and redirects do not become successful empty discovery.

`pageTeamsChatDiscovery` pages ordinary chat/meeting records, excludes Notes,
spaces and system streams, deduplicates overlaps and preserves continuation even
when filtering leaves an empty page. Cursor replay binds account/limit and lasts
30 minutes or until reload, with 1,000 cursor and 100,000 observed-ID bounds.
Listing combines CSA with ten regional pages of 100 within 30 seconds; partial
CSA snapshots invoke the same fallback for triage. Failures preserve known chats
and report incomplete coverage; unauthorized/rate-limited requests propagate.
CSA records take precedence. Native marker triples preserve cleared/active
bookmark behavior; missing/malformed boundaries remain unknown. Partial channel
discovery is still reported independently through triage coverage.

Selected chat IDs beyond the automatic scan resolve via current roster membership
and exact account-scoped conversation metadata. The metadata ID/type must match
an ordinary chat/meeting. Newly discovered chat message writes recheck the roster
for the signed-in MRI; enumeration alone does not authorize arbitrary threads.

On 2026-10-08 live traversal completed in seven pages with 569 chats and 25
excluded conversations; continuation replay was stable. The real CSA snapshot
already contained those chats. A locally modified partial snapshot retaining one
CSA chat recovered 568 omitted chats from live regional reads. Exact chat reads,
current roster checks and direct resolution with a locally empty CSA chat list
also passed. These simulations test fallback against live metadata, not an
observed production partial response. No writes or fresh sign-ins occurred.
All 168 tests passed, including HTTP routing, empty-page/overlap continuation,
scoped replay, malformed/foreign links, bounded failure coverage and roster denial.
